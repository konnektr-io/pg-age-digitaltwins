# Digital Twins for Apache AGE

AgeDigitalTwins is an SDK and API designed to support Digital Twins applications running on PostgreSQL with the Apache AGE extension. It supports DTDL (Digital Twins Definition Language) data models and allows for the validation of instances loaded in the graph database. The API and SDK are designed to make the transition from Azure Digital Twins easy.

## Features

- **DTDL Support**: Full support for DTDL data models.
- **Graph Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL with the Apache AGE extension for graph database capabilities.
- **Validation**: Validate instances loaded in the graph database.
- **Easy Transition**: Designed to make the transition from Azure Digital Twins seamless (compatible with Azure Digital Twins APIs).
- **MCP Protocol**: Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide context to LLMs.
