nektr Platform - Application Scope & Boundaries

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the scope, responsibilities, and boundaries for each application within the Konnektr Platform to prevent overlapping functionality, reduce development friction, and ensure all components integrate into a cohesive, scalable, and maintainable system.

## üèóÔ∏è Platform Architecture

### Control Plane vs Data Plane

The Konnektr Platform is divided into two distinct logical planes:

**Control Plane (KtrlPlane, DB Query Operator)**

- Manages lifecycle of all resources, users, organizations, billing, and access control
- Central administrative backbone of the entire platform
- Provides centralized authentication and authorization

**Data Plane (Products: Graph, Flow, Assembler, Compass)**

- User-facing products for building and running digital twin solutions
- Tenants of the Control Plane
- Focus on domain-specific functionality

## üìã Guiding Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each application has a single primary responsibility and excels at that function.

### 2. Decoupled Architecture

- No direct knowledge of other applications' internal logic or databases
- All interactions through well-defined, versioned REST/gRPC APIs
- Asynchronous communication via message bus (Dapr)

### 3. Declarative Operations

- Data Plane applications make declarative requests to KtrlPlane API
- KtrlPlane and DB Query Operator reconcile desired vs actual state
- No direct infrastructure management by product applications

### 4. Centralized Identity & Access Management

- All authentication/authorization managed by KtrlPlane
- Other applications are clients of KtrlPlane's IAM service
- No separate user tables in product databases

### 5. Consistent User Experience

- All applications use shared Konnektr Design System (shadcn/vite)
- Seamless experience across the platform

## üè¢ Application Scopes

- Product repos push doc changes via GitHub Actions/PRs

**Architecture:**
- Separate Vite/React/MDX/Shadcn project (konnektr-docs)
- Content organized by product, with live React components for demos
- Deployed to docs.konnektr.com via static hosting/CDN

## üîÑ Boundary Evolution

When requirements blur these boundaries:

1. **First**: Try to solve within existing scope
2. **Second**: Create clear handoff points to appropriate applications
3. **Last Resort**: Discuss boundary changes with architecture team

## üìù Compliance Checklist

Before implementing any feature, verify:

- [ ] Does this belong in Konnektr Home's marketing scope?
- [ ] Am I maintaining separation from platform functionality?
- [ ] Are all user management features redirected to KtrlPlane?
- [ ] Does this enhance the marketing and discovery experience?
- [ ] Will this support seamless transitions to the platform?
