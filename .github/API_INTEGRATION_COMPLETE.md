# API Integration & Service Refactoring - Completed ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated all API logic from `TwinsApiService` into the Zustand stores (`digitalTwinsStore` and `modelsStore`), replacing mock data with real Azure Digital Twins API calls. The `TwinsApiService.ts` file has been removed as it was an unnecessary abstraction layer.

## Changes Made

### 1. Digital Twins Client Factory (`digitalTwinsClientFactory.ts`)

- ✅ Added mock `TokenCredential` implementation for development
- ✅ Removed dependency on external `@azure/core-auth` package (using local interfaces)
- ✅ Fixed `process.env` usage to use Vite's `import.meta.env.VITE_TWINS_PROXY`
- ✅ Returns properly typed `DigitalTwinsClient` (removed `| null` return type)
- ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc comments

### 2. Constants Migration

- ✅ Moved constants from `src/services/constants.ts` to `src/utils/constants.ts`
- ✅ Removed old constants file from services folder
- ✅ Constants include:
  - `REL_TYPE_OUTGOING`, `REL_TYPE_INCOMING`, `REL_TYPE_ALL`
  - `QUERY_ALL_TWINS`

### 3. Digital Twins Store (`digitalTwinsStore.ts`)

- ✅ Replaced all mock data with real Azure Digital Twins API calls
- ✅ Added `getClient()` helper function that uses `connectionStore`
- ✅ Implemented all twin operations:
  - `loadTwins()` - Query all twins using ADT query
  - `createTwin()` - Upsert digital twin
  - `updateTwin()` - Update twin using JSON Patch operations
  - `deleteTwin()` - Delete twin and all its relationships
  - `getTwinById()` - Get single twin by ID (new method)
  - `queryTwins()` - Execute custom ADT queries (new method)
- ✅ Implemented all relationship operations:
  - `loadRelationships()` - Load relationships for a twin or all
  - `createRelationship()` - Create/upsert relationship
  - `updateRelationship()` - Update relationship using JSON Patch
  - `deleteRelationship()` - Delete relationship
  - `getRelationship()` - Get single relationship (new method)
  - `queryRelationships()` - Query relationships by type (new method)
- ✅ All operations properly handle errors and loading states
- ✅ Removed mock data imports

### 4. Models Store (`modelsStore.ts`)

- ✅ Replaced all mock data with real Azure Digital Twins API calls
- ✅ Added `getClient()` helper function that uses `connectionStore`
- ✅ Implemented all model operations:
  - `loadModels()` - List all models with definitions
  - `getModelById()` - Get single model by ID (new method)
  - `uploadModel()` - Create single model
  - `uploadModels()` - Create multiple models (new method)
  - `updateModel()` - Delete and recreate model (models are immutable)
  - `deleteModel()` - Delete model
  - `decommissionModel()` - Decommission model (new method)
- ✅ Added `toExtendedModel()` helper for type conversion
- ✅ Validation logic remains in place (to be enhanced with DTDLParser later)
- ✅ Removed mock data imports

### 5. Removed Files

- ✅ `src/services/TwinsApiService.ts` - All functionality migrated to stores
- ✅ `src/services/constants.ts` - Moved to utils folder

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ **Yes, it's good practice to call the Azure SDK directly from Zustand stores!**

**Reasons:**

1. **Simplicity**: Eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers
2. **Maintainability**: All state and API logic in one place
3. **Type Safety**: Direct use of Azure SDK types
4. **Modern Pattern**: Aligns with React/Zustand best practices
5. **Clarity**: Easier to understand data flow

### Before (Anti-pattern):

```
Component → Store → TwinsApiService → Azure SDK → API
          (state)   (wrapper)         (client)
```

### After (Best practice):

```
Component → Store → Azure SDK → API
          (state)  (client)
```

## Connection Management

Both stores now use `connectionStore` to get the endpoint and check connection status:

```typescript
const getClient = (): DigitalTwinsClient => {
  const { endpoint, isConnected } = useConnectionStore.getState();

  if (!endpoint || !isConnected) {
    throw new Error("Not connected to Digital Twins instance.");
  }

  return digitalTwinsClientFactory(endpoint, endpoint);
};
```

## Authentication Status

- ✅ Mock `TokenCredential` implemented in `digitalTwinsClientFactory.ts`
- ⏳ Auth0 integration pending (Phase 5)
- ⏳ JWT token handling pending (Phase 5)

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: UI Integration

- Update components to use the new store methods
- Remove any remaining references to `TwinsApiService`
- Test all CRUD operations through the UI
- Implement proper error handling in UI components

### Phase 5: Authentication

- Implement Auth0 integration
- Replace `MockTokenCredential` with Auth0 token provider
- Add token refresh logic
- Test authenticated API calls

### Phase 6: Testing

- Add unit tests for store actions
- Add integration tests with mock Azure SDK
- Test error scenarios
- Test connection state management

## Files Changed

```
Modified:
  src/services/digitalTwinsClientFactory.ts
  src/stores/digitalTwinsStore.ts
  src/stores/modelsStore.ts

Created:
  src/utils/constants.ts

Removed:
  src/services/TwinsApiService.ts
  src/services/constants.ts
```

## Verification

Run the following to verify no imports of removed service:

```powershell
# Should return no results
grep -r "TwinsApiService" src/
```

All TypeScript compilation errors resolved except for transitive dependency type resolution (not blocking).
