## Overview

The Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) is a language for describing models and their relationships in a digital twin environment. AgeDigitalTwins supports DTDL versions 2 through 4, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of use cases.

DTDL models define the structure, properties, and relationships of digital twins. These models are essential for creating a consistent and interoperable digital twin ecosystem.

## Generating DTDL Models from Ontologies

DTDL models can be generated from linked data ontologies. Tools like [OntoManager](https://ontomanager.konnektr.io) simplify the management of linked data ontologies and will soon include a converter to DTDL.
