# Connecting to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models and agents to interact with external tools and services. Konnektr Graph includes a built-in MCP server that exposes the Digital Twin capabilities as a set of tools that an AI agent can use.

This allows an AI to directly query, create, update, and manage your digital twin graph in a structured and validated way.

## Endpoint and Connection

The shared MCP server is a single endpoint for all Konnektr Graph instances. You specify which graph instance you want to connect to by using the `resource_id` query parameter.

**Endpoint URL:**
```
https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id={your-resource-id}
```

- **`{your-resource-id}`**: The unique identifier for your Konnektr Graph instance.
- **Transport**: The server supports `http_stream` (also known as Server-Sent Events or SSE).

## Authentication

The MCP server uses **OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration**, as described in the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/authorization).

This is a secure, user-friendly approach that **does not require you to manually manage `client_id` or `client_secret`**. When your MCP client connects for the first time, it will be guided through a one-time browser-based authorization flow to grant access.

### Client Configuration Example (Claude Desktop)

Here is an example of how to configure a compatible MCP client, such as Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "konnektr": {
      "url": "https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id=your-resource-id",
      "transport": {
        "type": "http_stream"
      },
      "auth": {
        "type": "oauth2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The client only needs to know the URL and that the authentication type is `oauth2`. The rest is handled automatically.

### Claude CLI Configuration

To add the Konnektr Graph MCP server to your Claude CLI, use the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add konnektr-graph --transport http https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id=your-resource-id
```

This command sets up the connection named `konnektr-graph` using HTTP transport to the specified MCP endpoint.

## Connecting with `npx mcp-remote`

For MCP clients that do not natively support remote HTTP endpoints or the OAuth 2.1 flow (e.g., some versions of Claude Desktop), you can use the `mcp-remote` tool to create a secure local proxy.

### How it Works
`mcp-remote` connects to the remote Konnektr MCP server, handles the OAuth authentication flow in your terminal, and then exposes a local WebSocket server that your client can connect to without needing to handle authentication itself.

### Steps
1. **Run `mcp-remote`**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `{your-resource-id}` with your instance ID:
   ```bash
   npx mcp-remote --url https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id={your-resource-id}
   ```

2. **Authenticate**:
   The tool will open a browser window for you to log in and authorize the connection.

3. **Connect Your Client**:
   Once authenticated, `mcp-remote` will print a local WebSocket URL, like `ws://localhost:3999`. Configure your MCP client to connect to this local address. No authentication settings are needed in the client itself.

## Demo Instance
For testing and evaluation, a public demo instance is available. It does not require authentication.

- **Demo URL**: `https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id=demo`
- **With `mcp-remote`**: `npx mcp-remote --url https://mcp.graph.konnektr.io/mcp?resource_id=demo`


## Available Tools

When an AI agent connects to the MCP server, it gains access to a suite of tools to interact with the digital twin graph.

### Model Management
- **`create_model`**: Creates a new DTDL model.
- **`delete_model`**: Deletes a DTDL model.
- **`get_model`**: Retrieves the full definition of a single DTDL model.
- **`list_models`**: Lists all DTDL models in the graph.
- **`search_models`**: Searches for DTDL models.

### Digital Twin Management
- **`create_or_replace_digital_twin`**: Creates or replaces a digital twin.
- **`delete_digital_twin`**: Deletes a digital twin.
- **`get_digital_twin`**: Retrieves a digital twin by its ID.
- **`update_digital_twin`**: Updates a twin's properties using a JSON Patch.
- **`search_digital_twins`**: Performs a semantic search for twins.

### Relationship Management
- **`create_or_replace_relationship`**: Creates or replaces a relationship between two twins.
- **`delete_relationship`**: Deletes a relationship.
- **`get_relationship`**: Retrieves a specific relationship.
- **`list_relationships`**: Lists all outgoing relationships from a twin.
- **`update_relationship`**: Updates a relationship's properties using a JSON Patch.

### Querying
- **`query_digital_twins`**: Executes a Cypher query against the graph.
