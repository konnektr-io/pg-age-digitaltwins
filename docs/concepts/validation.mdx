## Overview

Data model validation is a critical feature of AgeDigitalTwins, distinguishing it from regular graph databases. Validation ensures that models and twins conform to the DTDL specifications, maintaining consistency and correctness in the digital twin environment.

## Validation Process

- **Models**: Validated during upload using the open-source [DTDLParser](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl).
- **Twins**: Validated when created or replaced. Validation after a patch operation is currently under development.

## Key Benefits

- Ensures data integrity.
- Prevents invalid models or twins from being added to the graph.
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging.
