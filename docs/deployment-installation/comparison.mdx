description: Choose the right deployment option for your digital twin solution - fully managed hosted platform or self-hosted deployment
---

Konnektr Graph offers two deployment options to fit different needs. This guide will help you choose the right one for your use case.

## Quick Recommendation

**Most users should choose the Hosted Platform** - it's faster to deploy, fully managed, and includes enterprise features out of the box. Self-hosting is recommended only for advanced users with specific requirements.

---

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Hosted Platform | Self-Hosted |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | 1-2 hours |
| **Infrastructure Management** | Zero - fully managed | You manage everything |
| **Automatic Updates** | ✅ Always latest version | ❌ Manual updates required |
| **Scaling** | ✅ Automatic horizontal scaling | ⚠️ Manual configuration |
| **High Availability** | ✅ Built-in (multi-zone) | ⚠️ You must configure |
| **Monitoring & Alerting** | ✅ Included | ⚠️ You must set up |
| **Backup & Recovery** | ✅ Automated daily backups | ⚠️ You must configure |
| **Security Updates** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual patching |
| **Technical Support** | ✅ Included | ⚠️ Community-based |

## API & SDK Compatibility

| SDK/API | Hosted Platform | Self-Hosted |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Azure Digital Twins SDK** (.NET, Python, JS) | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Fully supported* |
| **Native AgeDigitalTwins SDK** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Direct database access |
| **REST API Compatibility** | ✅ 100% ADT-compatible | ✅ 100% ADT-compatible |
| **MCP Protocol** | ✅ Available | ✅ Available |

*Requires custom authentication configuration

## Authentication & Security

### Hosted Platform
- **Auth0 Integration** - Managed authentication service
- **JWT Token Validation** - Industry-standard security
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Organization and project-level permissions

### Self-Hosted
- **Bring Your Own Identity Provider** - Integrate with any OIDC/OAuth2 provider
- **Custom Authentication Logic** - Full control over auth flow
- **Network Policies** - Configure Kubernetes network policies
- **Certificate Management** - Manual cert-manager setup
- **Compliance** - You maintain compliance requirements

---

## Event Streaming & Integration

### Hosted Platform
- **Pre-configured Event Sinks** - Kafka, Kusto, MQTT ready to use
- **Managed Connectivity** - No firewall or network config needed
- **Event History** - Built-in event retention
- **CloudEvents Standard** - All events follow spec

### Self-Hosted
- **Custom Event Sinks** - Configure any sink you need
- **Network Configuration** - Full control over event routing
- **Data Sovereignty** - Events stay in your network
- **Custom Transformations** - Modify event pipeline

---

## Cost Considerations

### Hosted Platform

**Pricing Model:**
- Pay-as-you-go based on usage
- No infrastructure costs
- Includes monitoring, backups, and support
- Free tier available for development

**Hidden Savings:**
- No DevOps team time
- No infrastructure maintenance
- No upgrade planning
- Automatic optimization

**[View Pricing →](https://konnektr.io/graph)**

### Self-Hosted

**Infrastructure Costs:**
- Kubernetes cluster (cloud or on-prem)
- PostgreSQL with Apache AGE
- Load balancers and ingress
- Storage for backups
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

**Operational Costs:**
- DevOps engineer time
- Database administration
- Security patching
- Backup management
- Capacity planning

## When to Choose Hosted Platform

Choose the hosted platform if you:

✅ Want to focus on building digital twin solutions, not infrastructure  
✅ Need to get started quickly (hours, not weeks)  
✅ Don't have dedicated DevOps resources  
✅ Want automatic scaling and high availability  
✅ Prefer predictable operational costs  
✅ Need enterprise-grade security and compliance  
✅ Want to use Azure Digital Twins SDKs (easiest path)  

**Example Use Cases:**
- Smart building management solutions
- IoT device fleet management
- Industrial monitoring applications
- Proof-of-concept and MVP projects
- Startups and small teams

---

## When to Choose Self-Hosted

Choose self-hosting if you:

✅ Need direct database access for custom queries  
✅ Have specific compliance requirements (data residency, air-gapped)  
✅ Want to use the native AgeDigitalTwins SDK  
✅ Already have Kubernetes infrastructure and expertise  
✅ Need to integrate with custom authentication systems  
✅ Require custom PostgreSQL extensions or configurations  
✅ Have dedicated DevOps and database teams  

**Example Use Cases:**
- Highly regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Air-gapped or offline environments
- Custom graph algorithms and analytics
- Large enterprises with existing Kubernetes platforms
- Research projects requiring low-level access

## Migration Path

### Hosted to Self-Hosted

If you start with the hosted platform and later need to self-host:

1. **Export your DTDL models** via the API
2. **Export digital twin data** using bulk export
3. **Deploy self-hosted infrastructure** using our Helm charts
4. **Import models and data** into your self-hosted instance
5. **Update application endpoints** to point to your instance

### Self-Hosted to Hosted

If you start self-hosted and want to move to hosted:

1. **Sign up for Konnektr Platform** at ktrlplane.konnektr.io
2. **Create a new Graph resource**
3. **Export data from self-hosted** using bulk export
4. **Import into hosted instance** via API or UI
5. **Update authentication** to use Auth0 credentials
6. **Switch application endpoints** to hosted URLs

---

## Getting Started

### Start with Hosted (Recommended)

1. Visit [ktrlplane.konnektr.io](https://ktrlplane.konnektr.io)
2. Create your account (free)
3. Create a new Graph resource
4. Follow the [Quickstart Guide](../getting-started/quickstart)

### Start with Self-Hosted

1. Review the [Self-Host Deployment Guide](./self-host)
2. Prepare your Kubernetes cluster
3. Install via Helm chart
4. Configure authentication and networking
5. Follow the [SDK Reference](../reference/sdk)

---

## Support Options

### Hosted Platform
- **Email Support** - Direct access to engineering team
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and tutorials
- **Community** - GitHub Discussions and Slack
- **SLA** - Uptime guarantees (Enterprise tier)

### Self-Hosted
- **Community Support** - GitHub Issues and Discussions
- **Documentation** - Self-hosting guides and troubleshooting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch between hosted and self-hosted later?
Yes! Both options use the same underlying technology and APIs, making migration straightforward. See the Migration Path section above.

### Do both options support the same features?
Yes, both have feature parity. The main difference is who manages the infrastructure and which SDKs you can use.

### Is the self-hosted version truly open source?
Yes! The entire codebase is Apache 2.0 licensed. You have full access to the source code and can modify it as needed.

### What about vendor lock-in?
Since we're built on standard PostgreSQL and Apache AGE, and support Azure Digital Twins APIs, you have multiple exit strategies and aren't locked into proprietary formats.

### Can I use Azure Digital Twins SDKs with self-hosted?
Yes, but you'll need to implement a custom credential provider for authentication. The hosted platform provides this out of the box.

## Still Not Sure?

Start with the hosted platform - it's free to try and you can always migrate to self-hosted later if your requirements change.
