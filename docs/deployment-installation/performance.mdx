# Performance Tuning (Self-Hosted)

This guide covers advanced performance tuning for self-hosted Konnektr Graph deployments. These optimizations require direct access to the PostgreSQL database and infrastructure configuration.

      <strong>Self-Hosted Only:</strong> This guide applies to self-hosted deployments where you have direct control over PostgreSQL configuration. For hosted Konnektr Graph, performance is automatically optimized.

## Rate Limiting

The API service includes built-in rate limiting to protect against overload and ensure fair usage across clients. The system uses a simplified policy structure based on operation types and resource intensity.

### Rate Limiting Policies

The following rate limiting policies are applied per user/IP address:

| Policy | Operation Types | Requests per Second | Queue Limit | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Global** | All endpoints | 1,000 | 200 | Safety net across all APIs |
| **Light Operations** | GET single items, list operations | 100 | 50 | Low-impact read operations |
| **Medium Operations** | Query API, batch reads | 50 | 25 | Moderate resource usage |
| **Heavy Operations** | Create/Update/Delete operations | 20 | 10 | High-impact write operations |
| **Admin Operations** | Model management, job operations | 50 per minute | 25 | Administrative functions |

### Endpoint Classifications

- **Light Operations**: Digital twin GET, relationship GET, list operations
- **Medium Operations**: Query API for graph traversals and searches  
- **Heavy Operations**: Digital twin CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE, relationship CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
- **Admin Operations**: Model management, import job management

### Configuration

All settings can be customized through the `Parameters` section in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    // PostgreSQL Connection Settings
    "ConnectionIdleLifetime": 60,
    "ConnectionLifetime": 300,
    "MaxPoolSize": 100,
    "MinPoolSize": 0,
    "ConnectionTimeout": 15,
    "CommandTimeout": 30,
    
    // Rate Limiting Settings (per second unless noted)
    "GlobalPermitLimit": 1000,
    "GlobalWindowSeconds": 1,
    "LightOperationsPermitLimit": 100,
    "LightOperationsWindowSeconds": 1,
    "MediumOperationsPermitLimit": 50,
    "MediumOperationsWindowSeconds": 1,
    "HeavyOperationsPermitLimit": 20,
    "HeavyOperationsWindowSeconds": 1,
    "AdminOperationsPermitLimit": 50,
    "AdminOperationsWindowMinutes": 1,  // Note: per minute
    
    // Database Protection Settings
    "MaxConcurrentRequestsPerUser": 50,
    "MaxQueryComplexityPerWindow": 20000,
    "BaseQueryComplexity": 1
  }
}
```

### Environment Variable Support

All parameters support environment variable overrides using the pattern `Parameters__<SettingName>`:

```bash
# PostgreSQL settings
Parameters__MaxPoolSize=200
Parameters__ConnectionTimeout=30

# Rate limiting settings  
Parameters__GlobalPermitLimit=2000
Parameters__LightOperationsPermitLimit=200
Parameters__HeavyOperationsPermitLimit=50
```

### Error Response

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns HTTP 429 with details:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
  "retryAfterSeconds": 1.0
}
```

## PostgreSQL Performance Tuning

For optimal performance, especially when using Apache AGE with digital twins data, proper PostgreSQL configuration is crucial.

### Cluster Configuration

When deploying PostgreSQL in a cluster (e.g., using CloudNativePG), consider these resource and storage configurations:

```yaml
cluster:
  instances: 3
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: 3Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 50m
      memory: 1000Mi
  storage:
    size: 64Gi
    pvcTemplate:
      storageClassName: managed-csi-premium
  walStorage:
    enabled: true
    size: 64Gi
    pvcTemplate:
      storageClassName: managed-csi-premium
```

### PostgreSQL Parameters

Key parameters for performance optimization:

```yaml
postgresql:
  parameters:
    # Connection Management
    max_connections: '200'          # Adjust based on expected concurrent users
    
    # Memory Configuration
    shared_buffers: 512MB           # 25% of available RAM for caching
    
    # WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Configuration
    wal_compression: lz4            # Compress WAL files to save space
    max_wal_size: 2GB              # Maximum WAL size before checkpoint
    min_wal_size: 512MB            # Minimum WAL size to keep
    wal_keep_size: 512MB           # WAL files to keep for replication
    max_slot_wal_keep_size: 1GB    # WAL to keep for replication slots
    
    # Checkpoint Configuration
    checkpoint_flush_after: 2MB     # Flush dirty pages incrementally
    wal_writer_flush_after: 2MB     # WAL writer flush frequency
    checkpoint_completion_target: "0.9"  # Spread checkpoint I/O
    checkpoint_timeout: 5min        # Maximum time between checkpoints
```

### Performance Recommendations

#### Memory Settings
- **shared_buffers**: Set to 25% of available RAM (512MB for 2GB systems)
- **effective_cache_size**: Set to 75% of total system memory
- **work_mem**: Start with 4MB, increase for complex queries

#### Connection Pool Settings
- **max_connections**: Match your application's connection pool size
- **Connection pooling**: Use PgBouncer or similar for high-concurrency scenarios

#### WAL and Checkpointing
- **wal_compression**: Use `lz4` for good compression with minimal CPU overhead
- **checkpoint_completion_target**: Set to 0.9 to spread checkpoint I/O over time
- **max_wal_size**: Increase for write-heavy workloads to reduce checkpoint frequency

#### Storage Considerations
- Use SSD storage for both data and WAL files
- Separate WAL storage for better I/O performance
- Use premium storage classes in cloud environments

### Monitoring and Optimization

Monitor these key metrics:
- Connection usage and pool efficiency
- Buffer hit ratio (target: >95%)
- Checkpoint frequency and duration
- WAL generation rate
- Query performance and slow query logs

### Apache AGE Specific Tuning

For graph workloads with Apache AGE:
- Increase `work_mem` for complex graph traversals
- Monitor memory usage during large graph operations
- Consider partitioning large graph datasets
- Use appropriate indexes on graph node and edge properties
