Welcome! This guide will help you get started quickly with Konnektr Graph, our hosted digital twins platform built on Age Digital Twins.

## What is Konnektr Graph?

Konnektr Graph is a high-performance, Azure Digital Twins-compatible digital twin runtime that runs in our hosted cloud environment. It provides:

- **Full ADT API compatibility** - Use existing Azure Digital Twins SDKs
- **Real-time eventing** - Stream twin state changes to various sinks
- **Query engine** - Powerful Cypher queries over Apache AGE
- **Managed infrastructure** - No setup required, fully hosted

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Create Your Konnektr Account
Visit [ktrlplane.konnektr.io](https://ktrlplane.konnektr.io) and sign up for your free account.

### 2. Create a Graph Resource
1. Navigate to your organization dashboard
2. Click "Create Resource" â†’ "Konnektr Graph"
3. Configure your graph settings:
   - **Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your graph
   - **Event Sinks** (optional): Configure Kafka or Kusto sinks for real-time events
   - **Event Routes** (optional): Route specific events to your sinks

### 3. Get Your Graph Endpoint
Once deployed, you'll receive your unique graph endpoint:
```
https://your-graph-name.api.graph.konnektr.io
```

### 4. Connect with Azure Digital Twins SDKs
Use any Azure Digital Twins SDK with a custom Auth0 token credential:

```python
# Python example
from azure.digitaltwins.core import DigitalTwinsClient
from your_auth import KonnektrTokenCredential  # Custom implementation

credential = KonnektrTokenCredential(
    domain="auth.konnektr.io",
    audience="https://api.graph.konnektr.io"
)
client = DigitalTwinsClient("https://your-graph-name.api.graph.konnektr.io", credential)
```

### 5. Start Building
You're ready to:
- Upload DTDL models
- Create digital twins
- Establish relationships
- Query your graph
- Stream real-time events
