This guide walks you through setting up Konnektr Graph in our hosted environment via KtrlPlane.

## Prerequisites

- A Konnektr account at [app.konnektr.io](https://app.konnektr.io)
- An organization and project set up in KtrlPlane

## Creating a Graph Resource

### 1. Access Resource Creation

1. Log into your Konnektr dashboard
2. Navigate to your organization
3. Select or create a project
4. Click "Create Resource"
5. Choose "Konnektr Graph"

### 2. Basic Configuration

**Resource Name**: Choose a unique name for your graph instance. This will be part of your API endpoint.

### 3. Event Sinks (Optional)

Configure external systems to receive real-time events from your digital twins:

#### Kafka Sink
Stream events to Apache Kafka with federated credentials:
- **Name**: Unique identifier for this sink
- **Broker List**: Comma-separated list of Kafka brokers
- **Topic**: Target Kafka topic
- **SASL Mechanism**: Uses OAUTHBEARER with federated credentials

#### Kusto Sink  
Stream events to Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) or Microsoft Fabric:
- **Name**: Unique identifier for this sink
- **Ingestion URI**: ADX cluster ingestion endpoint
- **Database**: Target database name

### 4. Event Routes (Optional)

Define which events go to which sinks:

- **Sink Name**: Select from configured sinks
- **Event Format**: 
  - `EventNotification`: Real-time twin state changes
  - `DataHistory`: Historical data format compatible with Azure Digital Twins

### 5. Deploy Your Graph

Click "Create Resource" to deploy your graph. The system will:

1. Provision your graph database
2. Configure Apache AGE with PostgreSQL
3. Set up event routing infrastructure
4. Generate your unique API endpoint

## Resource Endpoints

Once deployed, you'll have access to:

- **API Endpoint**: `https://your-graph-name.api.graph.konnektr.io`
- **Authentication**: Auth0 with audience `https://api.graph.konnektr.io`
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI available at your endpoint

## Authentication Setup

Your graph uses Auth0 for authentication. You'll need to:

1. Get your Auth0 domain: `auth.konnektr.io`
2. Use audience: `https://api.graph.konnektr.io`
3. Implement a custom TokenCredential for Azure SDKs

See [First Steps](./first-steps) for detailed authentication examples.

## Resource Management

From your KtrlPlane dashboard, you can:

- **Monitor**: View resource health and metrics
- **Configure**: Update event sinks and routes
- **Scale**: Adjust resource allocation
- **Logs**: Access application logs and diagnostics
- **Delete**: Remove the resource when no longer needed
