# Import Jobs

Import jobs allow you to bulk ingest data into Konnektr Graph using cloud storage blobs. This guide explains how import jobs work, how to use SAS tokens for Azure Blob Storage, and outlines future support for AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

## Overview

An import job is a background process that reads data from an input blob (e.g., NDJSON, CSV) and writes results to an output blob. This is useful for bulk loading twins, relationships, or telemetry data.

## Supported Storage Providers

- **Azure Blob Storage (SAS tokens)**: Supported in hosted and self-hosted deployments.
- **Managed Identity (Azure)**: Only available in self-hosted deployments.
- **AWS S3 & Google Cloud Storage**: Planned for future releases.

## Using SAS Tokens (Azure Blob Storage)

For hosted deployments, import jobs require Azure Blob Storage URIs with SAS tokens. SAS tokens grant temporary, scoped access to blobs without needing Azure credentials.

**Example Blob URI:**
```
https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blob>?sv=...&sig=...
```

- The SAS token must be included in the URI query string.
- Both input and output blob URIs must be accessible with the provided SAS token.
- No Azure credentials or managed identity are required for hosted mode.

## How Import Jobs Work

1. **Create an import job** via the API, providing:
   - `inputBlobUri`: The source blob URI (with SAS token).
   - `outputBlobUri`: The destination blob URI (with SAS token).
   - Additional job parameters as needed.
2. The job runs in the background, reading from the input blob and writing results to the output blob.
3. You can monitor job status, cancel, or resume jobs via the API.

## Future Support

- **AWS S3**: You will be able to provide S3 URIs and credentials or pre-signed URLs.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Support for GCS URIs and signed URLs is planned.

## Notes

- For self-hosted deployments, you may use managed identity for Azure Blob Storage if your environment supports it.
- All blob URIs must be valid and accessible from the Konnektr Graph instance.
- See the [API Reference](../reference/api) for endpoint details and request formats.
