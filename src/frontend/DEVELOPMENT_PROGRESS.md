# Konnektr Graph Explorer - Development Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### üîß **Phase 1-3: Critical Infrastructure**

- **Fixed Resizable Panel Issues**: Resolved conflicts where moving one panel affected others by adding proper React keys for panel re-rendering
- **Digital Twin Data Models**: Implemented comprehensive DTDL-compatible data structures with realistic mock data matching Azure Digital Twins format
- **Inspector Panel Integration**: Added full inspector functionality with click handlers in query results to populate twin, relationship, and model details

### üìä **Phase 4: Graph Visualization**

- **Sigma.js Integration**: Successfully installed and configured Sigma.js with graphology for interactive graph visualization
- **Graph Viewer Component**: Created comprehensive GraphViewer component with:
  - Interactive node/edge visualization
  - Color-coded nodes by model type (Building=red, Floor=orange, Room=yellow, Sensor=green, Device=blue)
  - Click-to-inspect functionality
  - Graph legends and statistics
  - Pan/zoom controls
  - Node highlighting on hover/selection

### üîç **Inspector System**

- **Multi-Type Inspector**: Created specialized inspectors for Digital Twins, Relationships, and Models
- **TwinInspector**: Displays twin identity, properties, and metadata with timestamps
- **RelationshipInspector**: Shows relationship details, source/target connections, and properties
- **ModelInspector**: Presents DTDL model definitions, contents, context, and validation status
- **Centralized State Management**: Implemented inspector store for cross-component item selection

### üìã **Query Results Enhancement**

- **Three View Modes**: Table view, Graph view, and Raw JSON view
- **Click-to-Inspect**: Table rows are clickable to populate inspector
- **Pagination**: Handles large result sets efficiently
- **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for query results

## üöÄ **How to Use New Features**

### **Graph Visualization:**

1. Execute any query in the query editor
2. Click the **Network** icon (üîó) in the view mode toggle
3. Interactive graph shows twins as colored nodes and relationships as edges
4. Click nodes to inspect twins in the right panel
5. Use mouse to pan/zoom the graph

### **Inspector Panel:**

1. Click any item in query results (table or graph)
2. Right panel populates with detailed information
3. View properties, metadata, relationships, or model definitions
4. Use search to filter inspector content

### **Panel Management:**

- Panels are now properly resizable without conflicts
- Toggle left/right panels using header buttons
- Panel sizes are preserved during navigation

## ‚è≥ **Next Phase: Nested Results Enhancement**

The final phase involves implementing advanced nested query result display patterns as referenced in the provided mockup files.

## üõ† **Technical Stack**

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
- **State Management**: Zustand stores
- **Graph Visualization**: Sigma.js + Graphology
- **Data Structure**: Azure Digital Twins compatible models
- **Panel Management**: react-resizable-panels

## üîß **Development Environment**

- Server running on: `http://localhost:5173`
- All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- Hot module reloading enabled
- Real-time inspector integration functional
